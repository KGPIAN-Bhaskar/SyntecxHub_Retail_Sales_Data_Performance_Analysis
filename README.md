# 📊 Retail Sales Performance Analysis using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes retail sales data to uncover trends, evaluate category performance, and generate business insights using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and time-series visualization techniques.

The primary objective is to transform raw transactional data into meaningful insights through data cleaning, aggregation, and visual analysis.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw sales data
- Handle missing and formatted values
- Convert date columns into proper datetime format
- Analyze sales trends over time
- Compare performance across product categories
- Visualize sales contribution using charts

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Analysis Performed

### 🔹 Data Cleaning
- Removed formatting characters (commas, spaces)
- Converted sales column to numeric format
- Converted order date column to datetime
- Set datetime column as index for time-series analysis
- Handled missing values appropriately

### 🔹 Time-Series Analysis
- Resampled sales data on a monthly basis
- Plotted sales trends over time using line charts
- Identified peak and low-performing months
- Compared daily vs monthly aggregation to reduce noise

### 🔹 Category Analysis
- Aggregated total sales by category
- Compared category performance using bar charts
- Analyzed percentage contribution using pie charts

## 📊 Key Insights

- 📈 Monthly sales show an overall upward trend, indicating business growth over time.
- 🗓️ Clear seasonal fluctuations are visible, suggesting demand variation across months.
- 🏆 One or two categories contribute a significant portion of total revenue.
- 📉 Some months show noticeable dips, indicating possible external or seasonal effects.
- 📦 Sales distribution across categories is uneven, with high concentration in top-performing categories.
- 🔎 Monthly aggregation provides clearer business insights compared to daily-level data.

## 📌 Executive Summary

The analysis highlights that retail sales exhibit both growth patterns and seasonal variations. Category-level comparison reveals that revenue is concentrated among a limited number of product segments.

These insights can assist in:
- Inventory planning
- Targeted marketing campaigns
- Revenue forecasting
- Business strategy optimization

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Include profit margin analysis
- Perform Year-over-Year (YoY) growth comparison
- Apply rolling averages for trend smoothing
- Build an interactive dashboard (Plotly / Power BI)
- Implement forecasting models
